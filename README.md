# HAL-Mimic

This is a simple chatbot that uses Whatsapp data to predict responses based on input sentences. It is trained on the messages you receive and replies in the same way you would, to those messages. It contains two models for predictions, both of which use LSTMs.

The instructions on how to run this and the source code are well documented in the **Chatbot.ipynb** notebook.    
The code can be directly run and tested on Google colab.
